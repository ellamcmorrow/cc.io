Welcome to my Creative Coding Portfolio website.<br/>
My name is Ella McMorrow, I'm a final year Creative Computing student at IADT.<br/>
Below is a link to my Github repository containing samples of work from the last two years of Creative Coding module.<br/>
Work was created using p5.js. P5.js is a JS client-side library for creating graphic and interactive experiences, based on the core principles of Processing. <br/>
