Welcome to my Creative Coding Portfolio website.<br/>
My name is Ella McMorrow, I'm a final year Creative Computing student at IADT.<br/>
Below is are links to my github repositories and samples of work from my Creative Coding module.<br/>
Work was created using p5.js.<br/> P5.js a JS client-side library for creating graphic and interactive experiences, based on the core principles of Processing.<br/> Resources used include Gestaltung's generative design for web and The Nature Of Code by Daniel Shiffman.
